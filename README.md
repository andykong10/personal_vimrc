If you are using Ubuntu Linux, it is not needed to install `vi` from source.

Enable `+ruby` flag in `vi` when calling for `vi --version`

```
sudo apt-get install vim-nox
sudo apt-get install vim-rails
```

Now you should see `+ruby` when calling for `vi --version`.

Installing [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim), and keep the plugins you need.
